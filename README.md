# asset-classification
A repo with a classification for Asset Administration Shells

There is currently no standardized (from IDTA specified) way of classification of assets. See also https://github.com/foprs/submodel-template-proposals/issues/2

This repository lists classes for the Asset Administration Shell that can be used. Please open an issue in order to propose further classes.
